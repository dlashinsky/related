# RelateD

## Description

In a recent study from the CDC, 1 in 4 Americans suffer from some sort of physical or mental disability.  15%, or approximately 1 billion people worldwide are also disabled in some sort of way.

Day-to-day living for these people is much more taxing than it is for a person who does not have a particular disability or special need making their particular expereinces, desires and needs acute.  Additionaly many times the families of these people are the ones who take care of disabled folks, and especially parents of children who have disabilites and/or special needs.  Outside of routine medical support from doctors as well as other medical professionals tasked at aiding in the particular special need, it is difficult to find others who understand the acute struggles, needs and experiences they are facing.

This is precisely where relateD comes in: to connect the community of people who have disabilities and special needs with one another.  Considering there are several different types of disabilities and special needs, every subset has acute experiences that are worth sharing with others who are looking simply for support; those who have been/family member has been recently diagnosed searching for general information about the diagnosis/prognosis; looking for information regarding helpful products, businesses, physical locations that are relevant to that need.  Or simply put, connecting two families who experience the similar struggles to bond over it.


RelateD is a one stop shop solution for all communities who have to live with disabilites and/or special needs and are looking for a meaningful connection to a larger community who shares the same experience.
